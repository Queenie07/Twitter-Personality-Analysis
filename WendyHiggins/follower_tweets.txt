You either always will, or you never did in the first place.Just be you, and if people don’t like it, well, fuck them.When some things go wrong, take a moment to be thankful for the many more things that are still going right.Maybe I don't cry, but it hurts. Maybe I won't say, but I feel. Maybe I don't show, but I care.The tighter the hug the better it feels.We've been fooled into thinking we need others to be happy.One day you'll realize how much I caredI'm not asking you to hold me tight, just not to let me go that easy.Whenever you look for love, you'll find heartbreak and whenever you try to avoid heartbreak... you'll find love.Minus the bullshit, life is great.Don't overthink it, just let it go.Being a Hero has its Price....You don't know heartbreak until you see the waiter coming to your table with food but then take a sharp turn to a different table.The only exception ☆

easily satisfied with the bestIt's always darkest before the dawnKeep your head up...Keep your heart strongWhat a wonderful thought that some of the best days of our lives haven't happened yetEveryone deserves the chance to flyI wonder what normal people think aboutDestroy what destroys youWhen a dreamer dies,what happens to the dream??Love people not things,use things not peopleIn order to be irreplaceable one must always be differentYou may say I'm a dreamer,but I'm not the only oneMy middle finger salutes youThe number one reason people give up so fast is,because they look at how far they still have to go instead of how far they've gotten..If you have crazy friends..you have everything♥If you crazy friends...you have everything♥@mich939 oh hell no!!dis rerig net prentjies wt ek kry op tumblr..dan post ek dt op twitter...nothing deep behind it all@mich939 haha just random things I tweet..love you too♥The heart is a muscle,and what do muscles do when they're torn?They grow back •STRONGER•Don't be pushed by your problems..be led by your dreamsThere are all kinds of love in this world,but never the same love twice..Love me BRAVELYIf there are no ups and downs in your life..you're deadFollow your intuition..Be smart,be brave,,tell the truth..and don't take any shitAnd sometimes you just have to forget about that on person you loved..and move onBe bold or italic..never regular20 seconds of insane courage, 20 seconds of embarrassing bravery can lead to a lifetime of happiness...Brains are awesome..I wish everyone had oneNo guilt in life..No fear in deathAnd if the music is good,you danceMake it SIMPLE but SIGNIFICANT..A girl doesn't need anyone who doesn't need herWe're happy,free,confused and lonely at the same timeYou have to be willing to get happy about nothingToo bad you witty post was ruined by you inability to spellMy bed is a magical place where I suddenly remember everything I was supposed to doA girl plays with your heart...a woman explores itLife begins at the end of your comfort zoneYour clothes would look nice on my bedroom floorLearn to appreciate the things you have, before time makes you appreciate what you hadI left you because you never asked me to stayReal eyes Realize Real lies"@SpeakComedy: After an argument, I always think of awesome things I could have said."2013 will be my year!!Go big or go home!!Nothing's gonna stop us now baby!!:D"@Thato_Legend: Manchester United have been the best team in England for a good 20 years"Let that bitch play super Mario...bitches love taking it to the next levelInspiration exists but it has to find you workingIt's not about how you look,but about how you seeDon't let others influence your thoughtsWe all want to be different which makes us all the sameI'm a light sleeper but a heavy dreamerCan I borrow a kiss??I promise I'll give it backA person starts to live when he learns to live outside himselfKnowledge is power...Respect is everythingOnce we accept our limits we go beyond themI have good taste..I just don't have the money to prove it :'(Tell me my dreams are unrealistic and I'll tell you yours aren't big enoughDon't tell me the sky is the limit when I know there are footprints on the moon**Distance kinda sucks...the kitchen is so far away from the couchOn the bright side..my coffee won't get cold in hellLove means never having anything to say,because you're both looking at your smart phones...This is your life do what *YOU* love and do it often!!Crush a bit..little bit..roll it up..take a hitThe world is full of Kings and Queens who blind your eyes and steal your dreams"What a shame we all became such fragile broken things"Bad decisions make good storiesWe're all just kids who grew up way to fast!When we are young we read and believe the most fantastic thingsThere is a person out there for everyone..and your person may happen to be five catsBe strong enough to let go,and patient enough to wait for what you deserveLife is better when you're laughing :DNever stop dreaming!Don't lose who you are in the blur of the starsBe a voracious consumer of intelligenceDumb is NEVER cuteA drunken mind speaks a sober heartSeduce my mind and you can have my body..find my soul and I'm yours foreverPhysical attractions are common...but mental connections are rareYou have come this far don't give up now..If you wanna fly,you got to give up that shit that weighs you down..The truth about love is it's all a lie..I'm sorry..and by sorry I mean get over it..Talk is cheap...but actions are pricelessDon't be a Dick,be nice..it's that easy!!Less judgment more curiosityStars can't shine without darknessDon't let anyone ever dull your *sparkle*Silence is better than bullshitBe proud of who you are!!You create beauty with your attitude,your behavior,your actions...it's all up to youPeople are drawn to creativeness not competitiveness..Friends are like snowflakes all different and all beautifulA good laugh and a long sleep are the best cures for anythingI'm sorry you have mistaken me for a woman who will take your shit..If we loved again I swear I'd love you right..*Say my name like it's the last time,live today like it's your last night*@SpeakComedy please help me gain more followers!!#MemoriesIWontForget my childhood#MemoriesIWontForget my first kiss#MemoriesIWontForget going on holiday with my family♥#MemoriesIWontForget
