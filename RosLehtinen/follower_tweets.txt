@CNN https://t.co/yJit8LFj4G@MagicalPR Most of us are having trouble finding non-admin memorial pages for disasters on any kind in 2012 &amp; 2013. Any suggestions?@MagicalPR The memorial page I found only has posts from the page/admin: https://t.co/cRoeINWwds Is this okay?@MagicalPR Is it OK to use the definitions of DV's from packet verbatim &amp; w/o quotations? Or should we rephrase? Thanks! #manship4020@MagicalPR Thank you!@MagicalPR So is it safe to say that we can start from scratch (but keeping scales) to avoid repeats and unapproved questions? #manship4020@MagicalPR To clear up confusion, how exactly are we to transfer IRB focus group questions to Qualtrics if we can't rephrase the questions?@MagicalPR The rubric says to attach the questionnaire to our paper. Do we need to print the google doc from class and include it?
